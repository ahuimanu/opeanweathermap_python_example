# Open Weather Map API Example

this example requires that you obtain an open weather map API key
[Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

while this example could use better organization into functions, this code
reads from an API, fills values for City and ForecastRecord objects
and suggests how inserts into MySQL can be accomplished

## Dependencies
* [Python dotenv dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
